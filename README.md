# Neatoo
## Go beyond CRUD!!

Neatoo is a .NET Domain Model Framework implementing the principals in Enterprise Patterns and CSLA. With it you can create streamlined business applications in Blazor and WPF with complex behavior. With Neatoo's inherent meta properties, parent/child relationships, business rule validation, authentication, physical 2-tier factory and data binding take you well beyond CRUD. Roslyn source generators bring it to a new level of high performance.

Please see [the Person example app.](https://github.com/NeatooDotNet/Neatoo/tree/main/Examples/Person). This animations below highlights the behaviors.
