**Release Date:** 2026-01-13
**Type:** Patch Release (Dependency Update)
**Breaking Changes:** None

---

## Summary

Updates RemoteFactory dependency from 10.7.0 to 10.9.0, which fixes a regression where `entity.Save()` failed in `NeatooFactory.Logical` mode with "No factory save method is configured."

---

## Bug Fix

### NeatooFactory.Logical Mode Regression Fixed

Previously, calling `entity.Save()` directly (instead of `factory.Save(entity)`) in Logical mode would fail with:

```
SaveOperationException: No factory save method is configured.
```

This has been fixed in RemoteFactory 10.8.0. Both `entity.Save()` and `factory.Save(entity)` now work correctly in all modes (Server, Logical, Remote).

### RemoteFactory 10.8.0 Changes
- All generated factory methods now include optional `CancellationToken cancellationToken = default`
- Fixed Logical mode regression for `IFactorySave<T>` registration

### RemoteFactory 10.9.0 Changes
- New `FactoryMode.RemoteOnly` for client-only assemblies (Blazor WASM optimization)

---

## Migration Guide

**No action required.** This is a drop-in upgrade.

If you have KnockOff stub callbacks in unit tests, you may need to add a `token` parameter to match the new delegate signatures:

```csharp
// Before
stub.Fetch.OnCall = (ko, entities) => result;

// After
stub.Fetch.OnCall = (ko, entities, token) => result;
```
